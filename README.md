# EmpathE
One day I was having a picnic with my partner and some friends; when in a freak-occurance, a nearby gum tree collapsed and crushed my limbs & body. I broke a-LOT of bones, and there was internal damage done to some of my organs.

The road to recovery is a long one; and I have up and down days; but now that I have regained control of my right hand's fingers- I can write code again!

## My reason for this project
While stuck in the hospital bed, I read the Discourses of Epictetus (c.108 CE). Epictetus was a Greek slave in Rome, and a pioneering stoic philsopher. Of particular interest to me, was that he describes himself as a 'cripple' and a 'lame old man'. Some historians suggest that a sadistic master broke his legs while he was a slave; leading him to focus on developing his mental strengths and becoming a teacher. His reputation as an erudite philosopher would later earn him his freedom, and the school he opened would be patroned by some of the most influential people in Rome.

I found Epictetus' story to be inspiring- especially since I have also been rendered a 'cripple' by the tree. I thought as a rehabilitation project- to help get my hand working again- I could script a simple 'chatbot' to vent my feelings when I needed an outlet. The chatbot would be loaded with inspirational quotes taken from Epictetus and other sources, and could take on all my negative thoughts without ever being worn-out the way a human listener would be.

## Dedication
I dedicate this project to the nurses in Royal Melbourne Hospital's ICU and Trauma Ward. The comapssion and kindness that was shown to me (and the other patients in the ward) by these miracle workers, is more inspiring than any stoic quote could ever be.
